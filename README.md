# Background changer App

This is a simple React Native application built with Expo. 
When you tap anywhere on the screen, the background color changes to a randomly generated color with a smooth transition using react-native-reanimated.
All the generated colors are in rgb() format.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Run the app with `npx expo start`.
4. Using your physical device, read the QR Code to open the app (requires Expo Go app, available on app stores).

Enjoy!
